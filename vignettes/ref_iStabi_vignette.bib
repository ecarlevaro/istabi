  abstract  = {This paper studies inference in models that are identified by moment
	restrictions. We show how instability of the moments can be used
	constructively to improve the identification of structural parameters
	that are stable over time. A leading example is macroeconomic models
	that are immune to the well-known (Lucas (1976)) critique in the
	face of policy regime shifts. This insight is used to develop novel
	econometric methods that extend the widely used generalized method
	of moments (GMM). The proposed methods yield improved inference on
	the parameters of the new Keynesian Phillips curve.},
